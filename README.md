# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
This project was created to organize retiree data for the company Pewlett Hackard. The analysis will show how many people they need to hire to replace the retirees and prepare staff for current employees to reach retirment age. This analysis will also aide in preparing the retirement packages for the "Baby Boomer" generation. The number of retiring employees per title and employees eligible for a mentorship program was prepared for this project.

## Results: 
Mentorship Eligibility
* 1549 current employees are eligible for the mentorship program.
* 748 employees eligible for mentorship are engineering staff and 801 employees eligible for the program are either Senior Staff, Staff, or a Technique Leader.

Retiring Titles
* The data show that 72,458 people total are eligible for retirement.
pic of count vs title 
* 36,291 of these employees are some kind of engineer, which requires extensive education and training. 36,167 of these employees are general staff of some kind, depending on the type of work, these could be entry level positions that can be trained on the job.

## Summary: 

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
72,458 employees will be retiring, which means there will need to be 72,458 new employees hired to fill positions. 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
The number of employees eligible for mentorship is far lower than the amount of employees that will be hired. This means each engineering mentor would have to take on roughly 49 new employees and the ratio of miscellaneous staff mentors to new hires would be a 1 to 45 ratio.
